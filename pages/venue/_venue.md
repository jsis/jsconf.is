## Reykjavik, Iceland

Come and be inspired.

Reykjavik is a vibrant city filled with warm, hospitable people. It has a small-scale urban center that is easy to navigate. The hassle-free city center is clean, safe and packed with restaurants, shopping, culture and vibrant nightlife. Enjoy meeting the friendly locals, who speak English as their second language (and often other Scandinavian and European languages).

Iceland is a great place to experience gorgeous, incredibly varied, untouched nature. Drive just 30 minutes outside Reykjavik and you'll enter a whole different world, full of wonders including Gullfoss, Geysir and Þingvellir. Driving further you'll find huge waterfalls, "alien" landscape, active volcanoes, glaciers and much more. Iceland's unique color palette and landscapes can't be found anywhere else in the world.

## Getting to JSConf Iceland

Iceland is perfectly situated midway between the USA and Europe with only 3 hours flight from Europe and 5 hours flight from USA.

The best way to get to Reykjavik from the airport is by a bus.

**Icelandair Hotel Reykjavik Marina** is the official JSConf Iceland hotel. Located within walking distance from the venue, next to a historical dry-dock called Slippur, it blends the creative atmosphere of the downtown district with the country's strong fishing traditions.
